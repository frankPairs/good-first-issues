# Good first issues project

Why this project? To have fun and learn Rust!!

The main goal of this project is to build a place where software developers search for issues to start contributing to the OSS ecosystem.

This website includes a easy way to find repositories from several languages and their Good First issues. The list of repositories will be ordered by the ones with more issues with the tag "help-wanted".

Wish me luck!
